## Start running üöÄ

These instructions will allow you to obtain a copy of the running project in your local machine, for the purpose of development and testing.

### Prerequisites üìã

The things you will need to install the software are a computer that isn't too old, a text editor to help you read all the code with pretty colors, and the will to deal with code written by a growing developer!

### Installation üîß

1. Clone the repositories to your computer:
```
git clone git@github.com:Camilo-Suarez98/auto-market-frontend.git
```

and

```
git clone git@github.com:Camilo-Suarez98/auto-market-backend.git
```

2. Change directory to /elemental-frontend:
```
cd auto-market-frontend
```

Also change to /elemental-backend in the second repository:
```
cd auto-market-backend
```

3. Install the frontend and backend dependencies:

Make sure to have installed Node.js:
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Then, run npm install on each of the repositories:
```
npm install
```
OR
```
npm i
```


4. Create a `.env` file to include the backend URL.

As you can see in files i have an .env.example, this is a guide to call your environment variables wothout problems

5. Run the code!

Make sure to be in each repository:
```
cd auto-market-frontend
```
Once there, execute
```
npm run dev
```
For the backend, execute the same commands. Remember to keep both running!
